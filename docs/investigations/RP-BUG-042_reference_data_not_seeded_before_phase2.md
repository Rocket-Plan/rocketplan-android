# RP-BUG-042: Reference data not seeded before Phase 2 (iOS parity)

> iOS-parity review (2026-06-07). iOS seeds **global** reference caches before Phase 2 so offline
> pickers are always populated; Android pulls most of them **per project**, leaving a window where the
> pickers are empty.

## Symptom

On a fresh install (or before any project's metadata has synced), Android dropdowns/pickers that depend
on global reference data — **damage types, damage causes, claim types, scope actions, project types** —
can be **empty or incomplete**, especially offline or when creating an entity before a full project sync
has run. The user can't pick a damage type / claim type / scope action that iOS would already have.

## iOS reference

`Views/App/AppViewModel.swift` (~:1151–1157), at company-context-ready and **before** Phase 2:
- `DamageServiceImpl.prefetchDamageTypesIfNeeded()`
- `DamageServiceImpl.prefetchScopeActionsIfNeeded()`
- `ClaimServiceImpl.prefetchClaimTypesIfNeeded()`
- `ProjectServiceImpl.prefetchProjectTypesIfNeeded()`

Company-scoped catalogs (scope sheets, damage materials, equipment) are also prefetched (~:1185–1192),
and the global types are re-seeded on reconnect (~:1433–1443).

## Android current state (verified)

- The **only** up-front prefetch is the room-type catalog: `MainActivity.kt:352` →
  `RoomTypeRepository.prefetchOfflineCatalog(...)` (property types, levels, room types).
- `SyncQueueManager.ensureInitialSync` enqueues `EnsureUserContext → ProcessPendingOperations →
  SyncDeletedRecords → SyncProjects` — **no** prefetch of damage/claim/scope/project types.
- Damage types, claims, etc. arrive only as part of **per-project** metadata sync
  (`ProjectMetadataSyncService.syncProjectMetadata`) — so they exist after a project has been opened and
  synced, not before.

## Reachability / severity

P3: the gap bites a **fresh-install / first-use / offline-create-before-sync** path. Once any project's
metadata has synced, the relevant types are cached. Worth confirming with product which pickers are
truly global vs project-scoped before deciding how much to seed.

## Suggested approach

Mirror iOS: at company-context-ready (after `EnsureUserContext`, before/alongside `SyncProjects`),
prefetch the global reference catalogs (damage types, damage causes, claim types, scope actions,
project types) via their existing `get*`/sync paths, and re-seed on reconnect. Reuse the
`RoomTypeRepository.prefetchOfflineCatalog` pattern. Verify each type's endpoint exists and is global
(not project-scoped) before wiring.

## Observability

### Success Criteria
- On a fresh install, damage/claim/scope/project-type pickers are populated before opening any project
  (and offline), matching iOS.
